= DerbyDB Docker

_This was made for school, this isn't supposed to be run as a production instance. Also, the setup is pretty static and doesn't allow any customization._

To set this up for your project, copy the 3 Files into your directory of choice and run `docker-compose up -d`. +
The database files are in `./db`. +
You can connect to the running instance over port 1527. +
The credentials are `app:app`.
